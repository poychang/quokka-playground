# Quokka Playground

Quokka Playground runs your JavaScript and TypeScript code and displays results inline in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Quokka.js extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode).

[Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com/) is a developer productivity tool for rapid JavaScript / TypeScript prototyping. Runtime values are updated and displayed in your IDE next to your code, as you type.

## Playground Files

You can use JavaScript / TypeScript to play with Quokka. If you choose to use TypeScript with 3rd party libraries, you need to install related type file. For example, execute this command `npm install @types/lodash` to install types for [lodash](https://lodash.com/). Then you can play lodash with Quokka just like in `./playground/lodash.ts`.

Try to play with those files:

- `./playground/playground.js`
- `./playground/playground.ts`
- `./playground/lodash.ts`
- `./playground/rxjs.ts`
